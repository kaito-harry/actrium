## 1. Realm link samples

Syntax: see [Actr URI](../../../actr/protocols/uri.md).

```text
actr://acme.com/k7m2q9xh                         ; open instance k7m2q9xh@acme.com
actr://acme.com/notes/today?filter=assigned      ; an explicit readable RealmId, with a page path and query
https://acme.com/i/k7m2q9xh                      ; https form, acme.com declares links: ["/i/"]
actr://acme.com/2af01.k7m2q9xh                   ; an Actor within the instance (ActorId 2af01.k7m2q9xh@acme.com)
actr://<installation-id>.actr.alt/h3x8p2wq       ; a local Realm, not shareable
```

By default Actrium generates the RealmId at random (a short lowercase base32 string, without the
program name); the readable name goes into the Realm Profile's `display_name`. The user can
explicitly switch to a readable RealmId on the create-confirmation page, as with `notes` in the
example above.

An Actor within an instance is identified by an ActorId, e.g. `2af01.k7m2q9xh@acme.com`: dropping
`2af01.` gives the Realm name. Its link form is `actr://acme.com/2af01.k7m2q9xh`; this kind of
link stops working once a program upgrade replaces the Actor, so instance links are the default
for sharing. The program identity `publisher/program@version` is carried by the package manifest
and the Actor credential.

Legacy forms (`actr://notes.example/team-notes@1.4.2?service=…`, or `2af01@42/notes.example:team-notes:1.4.2`
with only a numeric `realm_id`) are always rejected and can only be imported through an explicit
migration tool.

## 2. Publisher Profile

The Publisher Profile is the optional `publisher` member of the authority descriptor (already
defined in Actr Authority Discovery §4.5); its entry point is the Publisher domain's single
bootstrap resource:

```text
https://notes.example/.well-known/actr
```

Sample (the `publisher` member uses snake_case; `domain` must match the `authority` hostname):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "authority": "actr://notes.example",
  "services": [
    {
      "rel": "contracts",
      "href": "https://notes.example/actr/contracts"
    }
  ],
  "publisher": {
    "schema": "actr.publisher/v1",
    "sequence": 17,
    "domain": "notes.example",
    "profile_signing_keys": [
      {
        "id": "publisher-root-1",
        "algorithm": "Ed25519",
        "public_key": "<base64>",
        "status": "active"
      }
    ],
    "keys": [
      {
        "id": "actr-pub-3f9a1c0d2b7e4a61",
        "algorithm": "Ed25519",
        "public_key": "<base64>",
        "not_before": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z",
        "not_after": "2027-04-01T00:00:00Z",
        "status": "active"
      },
      {
        "id": "actr-pub-8c2e5b7d1a4f9e03",
        "algorithm": "Ed25519",
        "public_key": "<base64>",
        "not_before": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "not_after": "2026-06-30T00:00:00Z",
        "status": "retired"
      }
    ],
    "security_contact": "mailto:security@notes.example",
    "profile_issued_at": "2026-07-29T00:00:00Z",
    "profile_expires_at": "2026-08-29T00:00:00Z",
    "signature": {
      "key_id": "publisher-root-1",
      "algorithm": "Ed25519",
      "value": "<base64>"
    }
  }
}
```

The `publisher.signature` object itself does not enter the payload; the rest of the `publisher`
member's JSON is normalized per RFC 8785 JCS and verified as a detached Ed25519 signature.
`sequence` must increase monotonically. The parts of the descriptor outside `publisher` are
unsigned and play no part in Publisher trust decisions. `profile_signing_keys` and the
optional `rotations` follow the format, acceptance, and rotation rules of
`realm_signing_keys` (Actr Authority Discovery §4.4). A package signing key's `id` is computed
from its public key and equals the manifest `signing_key_id`; `keys` has at most 8 entries, at
most 2 of them `active`, and a rotation publishes the new key first and signs packages with it
only 24 hours or more later ([Actor Package](../../../actr/protocols/actor-package.zh.md) §6.8,
Chinese only).

## 3. Package download

Which package an instance runs is written into its Realm Profile's `package` (sample in §6.2):

```json
"package": {
  "href": "https://cdn.notes.example/team-notes-1.4.2.actr",
  "sha256": "<64 hex>",
  "type": "notes.example/team-notes@1.4.2"
}
```

Actrium downloads `href` per [Realm Profile protocol](../../../actr/protocols/realm-profile.md) §6
(an HTTPS GET without credentials), checks `sha256`, and then verifies the manifest signature with
the package signing key from the Publisher Profile (§2); the Actor type the manifest declares is
the instance's program. The download address can be anywhere (a Publisher CDN, Loran package
hosting, object storage) — it is not a trust source.

## 4. `.actr` Manifest

Product v1 applications use the `actr-package/2` container. This is the signed Echo application manifest. The packager fills the sizes, hashes, protocol fingerprint, and key ID.

```toml
format = "actr-package/2"

[actor]
publisher = "echo.example"
name = "echo"
version = "0.1.0"

[workload]
profile = "actr.component/1"
entry = "bin/service.wasm"

[host]
profile = "actr.host/1"
api = "^1.0"

[signature]
algorithm = "ed25519"
key-id = "actr-pub-3f9a1c0d2b7e4a61"

[extensions.actrium]
title = "Echo Chat"
description = "A Keel Guest and a single Echo Service"

[extensions.actrium.application]
schema-version = 1
min-actrium-version = "1.0.0"
front-host-api = "^1.0"
service-host-api = "^1.0"

[extensions.actrium.application.front]
guest-runtime = "keel-js"
guest-entry = "ui/guest.bundle.js"
keel-api = "^1.0"
capability-manifest = "ui/capability-manifest.json"
contract-digest = "sha256:<capability file SHA-256>"

[extensions.actrium.application.service]
contract = "proto/echo.proto"
protocol-fingerprint = "sha256:<semantic contract SHA-256>"

[extensions.actrium.application.permissions.front]
capabilities = ["service"]

[extensions.actrium.application.permissions.service]
capabilities = []

[extensions.actrium.application.components]
allow = ["View", "Text", "ScrollView", "TextInput", "Button"]

[[files]]
path = "bin/service.wasm"
role = "workload"
media-type = "application/wasm"
size = 289392
sha256 = "<file SHA-256>"

[[files]]
path = "ui/guest.bundle.js"
role = "resource"
media-type = "text/javascript"
size = 7822
sha256 = "<file SHA-256>"

[[files]]
path = "ui/capability-manifest.json"
role = "profile"
media-type = "application/json"
size = 398
sha256 = "<file SHA-256>"

[[files]]
path = "proto/echo.proto"
role = "contract"
media-type = "text/plain"
size = 197
sha256 = "<file SHA-256>"
```

The signature covers the entire manifest, including the application extension. The capability digest matches the SHA-256 of its file entry. The initial standalone application validator supports one import-free Service Proto, a WASM Component, and a Keel Guest that calls local RPCs through `host:service`. The installer independently analyzes the Guest and applies runtime policy.

A future Native Capsule profile needs the following policy declaration as part of its own profile design.

```toml
[actrium.native_capsule]
profile = "privacy-closed-v1"
network = "broker-only"
workspace = "broker-only"
child_process = false
ptrace = false
shared_writable_memory = false
dynamic_libraries = "sealed"
ipc = ["actr.capability.v1"]
```

An in-process `NativeCdylib` does not use this profile, and must not be rated `CONTROLLED` on that
basis.

## 5. Keel Capability Manifest

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "keelApi": "1.0",
  "guestEntry": "ui/guest.bundle.js",
  "imports": [
    "react",
    "react/jsx-runtime",
    "keel/guest",
    "host:service",
    "host:clipboard"
  ],
  "hostModules": {
    "service": {
      "rpc": [
        "notes.v1.NoteService.List",
        "notes.v1.NoteService.Get",
        "notes.v1.NoteService.Save"
      ],
      "events": [
        "notes.v1.changed"
      ]
    },
    "clipboard": {
      "rpc": [
        "writeText"
      ]
    }
  },
  "components": [
    "View",
    "Text",
    "TextInput",
    "Button",
    "FlatList",
    "ImageAsset"
  ]
}
```

Actrium must not trust this file alone; the result of static installation analysis must agree with
it.

## 6. Realm signing key and Realm Profile

### 6.1 Realm signing key: authority descriptor extension

A domain's Realm signing key is published in that domain's descriptor:

```text
https://acme.com/.well-known/actr
```

Sample (the `realm_signing_keys` member and the `realms` relation are already defined in Actr
Authority Discovery §4.3–4.4):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "authority": "actr://acme.com",
  "services": [
    {
      "rel": "signaling",
      "href": "wss://signal.provider.example/actr",
      "protocol": "actr-signaling/1"
    },
    {
      "rel": "ice-config",
      "href": "https://rtc.provider.example/actr/ice",
      "protocol": "actr-ice-config/1"
    },
    {
      "rel": "realms",
      "href": "https://realms.provider.example/acme.com",
      "protocol": "actr-realm-profile/1"
    }
  ],
  "links": ["/i/"],
  "realm_signing_keys": {
    "sequence": 3,
    "keys": [
      {
        "id": "rs-2026-1",
        "algorithm": "Ed25519",
        "public_key": "<base64>",
        "status": "active"
      },
      {
        "id": "rs-2025-1",
        "algorithm": "Ed25519",
        "public_key": "<base64>",
        "status": "retired"
      }
    ],
    "rotations": [
      {
        "from": "rs-2025-1",
        "to": "rs-2026-1",
        "sequence": 2,
        "signature": "<base64>"
      }
    ],
    "signature": {
      "key_id": "rs-2026-1",
      "algorithm": "Ed25519",
      "value": "<base64>"
    }
  }
}
```

`realm_signing_keys.keys` is the long-term trust root for every Realm under that domain;
`rotations` holds one entry per rotation, each signed by the `from` key over the JCS form of
`{from, to, public_key, sequence}`, where `sequence` is the member `sequence` at which that
rotation was introduced. Removing a key from `keys` revokes every Realm Profile it signed.
`realm_signing_keys.signature` is signed by some `active` key over the JCS-normalized result of
that member with `signature` removed, covering `sequence`. The rest of the descriptor is unsigned
and does not list a Realm inventory. `links` declares that `https://acme.com/i/<realm_id>…` is the
https form of a Realm link (Actr Authority Discovery §4.6); the prefix is chosen by the domain and
has no default. The signaling, ice-config, and similar entries under `services` serve that
authority itself and have nothing to do with the Realms under that domain; accessing a Realm only
ever uses the Realm Infra Provider named in its own Realm Profile, and no other Realm Infra Provider may be
used when that Realm Profile is unavailable, invalid, or retired. A Realm Infra Provider's own descriptor
(`https://provider.example/.well-known/actr`) separately publishes its management-request endpoint
via a `realm-management` link (protocol `actr-realm-management/1`).

### 6.2 Realm Profile

The entry point is the `realms` relation's `href` plus the `realm_id`:

```text
https://realms.provider.example/acme.com/k7m2q9xh
```

Sample:

```json
{
  "schema": "actr.realm/v1",
  "sequence": 31,
  "realm": {
    "name": "k7m2q9xh@acme.com",
    "display_name": "Acme Notes",
    "status": "active"
  },
  "package": {
    "href": "https://cdn.notes.example/team-notes-1.4.2.actr",
    "sha256": "<64 hex>",
    "type": "notes.example/team-notes@1.4.2"
  },
  "issuer": {
    "url": "https://identity.provider.example/realms/acme.com/k7m2q9xh",
    "keys": [
      {
        "id": "7",
        "algorithm": "Ed25519",
        "public_key": "<base64>",
        "status": "active"
      }
    ]
  },
  "provider": {
    "id": "provider.example",
    "signaling": [
      {
        "url": "wss://signal-a.provider.example/ws",
        "priority": 10,
        "control_plane_id": "provider.example/v1",
        "ticket_audience": "signal-a"
      },
      {
        "url": "wss://signal-b.provider.example:8443/ws",
        "priority": 20,
        "control_plane_id": "provider.example/v1",
        "ticket_audience": "signal-b"
      }
    ],
    "ice": [
      {
        "urls": ["stun:stun.provider.example:3478"]
      },
      {
        "urls": ["turns:turn.provider.example:5349"],
        "credential_audience": "turn-pool-1"
      }
    ]
  },
  "policy": {
    "membership": "invite-only"
  },
  "issued_at": "2026-07-29T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": {
    "key_id": "rs-2026-1",
    "algorithm": "Ed25519",
    "value": "<base64>"
  }
}
```

`signature` is signed by an `active` key from `realm_signing_keys`; an Actor credential's issuer is
exactly `realm.name`, and where the Realm Profile is stored does not affect its validity. An
existing Realm Profile signed by a key that was later retired remains valid until superseded by a
higher `sequence`. A Realm Profile carries no expiry; rollback protection relies solely on
`sequence`. `provider.id` is the Realm Infra Provider's normalized DNS authority and is immutable for the
life of the Realm. Multiple signaling endpoints sharing a `control_plane_id` are replicas or
failover entry points of the same Realm Infra Provider presence/control plane, not v1 federation.
`package` gives the package the instance runs (§3); upgrading the program means publishing a Realm
Profile with a different `package` and a higher `sequence`. Rotating the Realm issuer key or
changing endpoints under the same Realm Infra Provider likewise means publishing a Realm Profile with a
higher `sequence`; retiring publishes a new Realm Profile with `status` set to `retired`, valid
forever after.

## 9. Front Launch Context

Read-only for the Guest:

```json
{
  "program": {
    "publisher": "notes.example",
    "name": "team-notes",
    "version": "1.4.2"
  },
  "route": "/today",

  "workspace": {
    "displayName": "Team Notes",
    "mode": "read-write"
  },
  "theme": "system",
  "locale": "zh-CN"
}
```

Not provided:

- Front/Service credential;
- session id/secret;
- Workspace path;
- an arbitrary Actor-call API;
- Realm client key;
- signaling/TURN endpoint credential.

### 9.1 Privacy state context

The Guest sees only a minimized, user-facing summary:

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "color": "green",
    "ready": true,
    "policyId": "actrium.consumer.default",
    "workloadKind": "wasm-component",
    "applicationStateDigest": "…",
    "expiresAt": "2026-07-29T12:01:15Z"
  }
}
```

The Guest does not get the Actor graph, raw evidence, an attestation token, or a hidden ActorId.
For the full object see [13](13-privacy-state-and-aggregation.md); for semantics see
