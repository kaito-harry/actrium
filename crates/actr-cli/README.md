# actr CLI

Command-line tool for Actor-RTC projects. Handles project scaffolding, codegen,
packaging (`.actr`), signing, installation of service dependencies, and runtime
instance management.

## Quick reference (21 top-level subcommands)

```
Development (flat, 5):  actr init | gen | build | check | doc
Runtime (flat, 7):      actr run | ps | logs | start | stop | restart | rm
Resources (grouped, 6): actr deps | pkg | registry | dlq | realm | publisher
Meta (3):               actr config | version | completion
```

Full help: `actr --help`, then drill down with `actr <command> --help`.

## Pack a staged Actrium application

Use an unsigned `actr-package/2` template to declare the main Component and
the Guest, capability manifest, and Proto files under `--payload-root`.
Declare the application under `[actrium.application]`.
For the signed schema see the
[Product v1 reference manifest](../../docs/product/actrium-v1/12-reference-spec.md#4-actr-manifest).
The pack command fills sizes, hashes, contract digests, and the signature key ID
and verifies the archive before writing it.

```sh
actr pkg keygen --publisher echo.example --no-register \
  --output build/signing-key.json --public-key-output build/public-key.json
actr pkg pack --manifest-path package.toml --payload-root build/stage \
  --key build/signing-key.json --output build/echo.actr
actr pkg verify --package build/echo.actr --pubkey build/public-key.json
```

Use the public-only JSON for verification. The explicit key options allow
the commands to run without reading or registering a default keychain.

## Publisher Profile keys and signing

The Publisher Profile signing key signs the domain's public metadata. The
package signing key signs `.actr` packages. Generate them separately:

```sh
actr publisher profile keygen --key-id publisher-root-1 \
  --output publisher-profile-key.json > publisher-profile-public.json
actr pkg keygen --publisher apps.example.com --output package-key.json

actr publisher profile sign --key publisher-profile-key.json \
  --domain apps.example.com --package-key package-key.json \
  --security-contact mailto:security@apps.example.com > publisher.json
```

`keygen` writes the private key with owner-only permissions on Unix and prints
only its public `profile_signing_keys` entry. It refuses to replace an existing
file unless `--force` is given and leaves the configured package keychain alone.

`sign` prints the complete signed `publisher` member. Insert that object into
the authority descriptor served at `https://apps.example.com/.well-known/actr`,
keeping the descriptor's `authority` and service links. The command uses the
protocol's JCS and detached Ed25519 implementation, derives every package key ID
from its public key, and checks the result with the consumer's acceptance path.
Both commands work offline outside a project.

The default sequence is `1`, valid for 30 days. For an update with the same
Profile signing key, increase `--sequence` and renew before expiry; change the
validity with `--valid-for-days`. The command constructs a Profile with one
Profile signing key; rotation chains for that key remain a separate tool.
Repeat `--package-key` to list package keys. Each file may be a keychain or
public-only JSON with `public_key` and optional `status` (`active` or `retired`),
`not_before` and `not_after`. Keep retired package keys listed while their
packages must remain verifiable. The protocol allows at most eight package
keys, including at most two active keys. Private material never enters the
printed Profile.

The Profile key file also works with the existing Publisher registration tool:

```sh
actr realm register-publisher --key publisher-profile-key.json \
  --publisher apps.example.com --provider infra.example.com
```

## Browser Host Realm client key

Run `actr run --web -c actr.toml`, open its local page, choose the authorized
Realm client key JSON file written by `actr realm join`, then select **Start
Actor**. The file must name the configured Realm and Issuer. The page passes
the key directly to its Service Worker before initialization; the worker
validates it and stores it in its scoped browser secret store. The page shows
the Actor as ready only after the worker confirms registration.

Select the key when opening the bundled page. Host-side
`deployment.realm_client_key` paths are not served to the browser, and private
key material is not included in `/actr-runtime-config.json` or uploaded to the
local static server. Package verification still uses public trust anchors.

## Organization principles

These rules govern where a new command lives. Add commands that fit; if a new
command doesn't fit, update this document **before** adding code.

### 1. Audience determines grouping

Commands serve three audiences. Keep their paths short in proportion to how
often the audience types them.

| Audience | Typical commands | Path depth |
|---|---|---|
| **Developer** (writes actor code) | `init`, `gen`, `build`, `check`, `doc` | flat |
| **Operator** (runs workloads) | `run`, `ps`, `logs`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `rm` | flat |
| **Integrator / publisher** (manages deps, packages, registry) | `deps ...`, `pkg ...`, `registry ...`, `dlq ...` | grouped |

**High-frequency stays flat** (Docker/Cargo precedent). **Low-frequency or
fine-grained stays grouped** so the top level stays scannable.

### 2. Group by resource, not by phase

Groups are named after **what the subcommand operates on**:

- `deps` — local dependency manifest / lockfile
- `pkg` — a local `.actr` package file (sign, verify, keygen)
- `registry` — the remote registry / Issuer (discover, publish, fingerprint)
- `dlq` — the Dead Letter Queue
- `realm` — a Realm signing key (keygen, and signed Realm management requests),
  and a member's Realm client key (join, invite, members, …)
- `publisher profile` — a Publisher Profile signing key and the signed
  `publisher` member of a domain's authority descriptor

**Do not** group by workflow phase (`build`, `release`, `ops`, etc.) — those
names rot as the workflow evolves.

### 3. Full-flow commands vs fine-grained operations

- `actr build` — full source-to-package pipeline (compile → hash → sign → zip).
  The default entry point for developers.
- `actr pkg sign / verify / keygen` — single-step operations against an existing
  manifest or package. Intended for debugging, CI glue, or signed-build splits.

The rule: **one top-level command per full workflow**; put individual steps in
a group. Never expose both `foo` and `group foo` with overlapping semantics.

### 4. Parameter conventions

- Manifest path: `--manifest-path` / `-m` (follows Cargo). Default
  `manifest.toml`.
- Runtime config (`actr.toml`): `--config` / `-c`.
- Output file: `--output` / `-o`.
- Signing key: `--key` / `-k`.
- Never reuse `-f`; reserve single-letter short flags for obvious mappings.

### 5. Internal flags stay hidden

Flags that only another subcommand or a spawned child should set MUST use
`#[arg(long = "internal-...", hide = true)]`. Users browsing `--help` shouldn't
see implementation plumbing.

### 6. Every subcommand implements `core::Command`

All command types implement [`actr_cli::core::Command`][trait]:

```rust
async fn execute(&self, ctx: &CommandContext) -> anyhow::Result<CommandResult>;
fn required_components(&self) -> Vec<ComponentType>;
fn name(&self) -> &str;
fn description(&self) -> &str;
```

Dispatch is a single call in `src/cli.rs::run`; the service container is only
built when `required_components()` is non-empty. This keeps commands that don't
need the network (e.g. `keygen`, `version`, `pkg sign`) cheap.

[trait]: ./src/core/container.rs

### 7. Output style

Return a structured `CommandResult` (variants: `Success`, `Install`,
`Validation`, `Generation`, `Error`). The dispatcher in `cli.rs` renders it.
Avoid `println!` inside command logic when the result should flow through the
standard renderer.

### 8. No backwards-compat aliases (pre-1.0)

Until the CLI is released, break freely. Renames go in a single PR with
everything — call sites, e2e tests, scaffold templates, docs — updated atomically.
Do **not** ship transitional aliases.

## Adding a new command — checklist

1. Decide the audience (Dev / Operator / Integrator) → determines whether it
   sits at the top level or inside a group.
2. Pick a resource-oriented noun if grouping is required; extend an existing
   group before creating a new one.
3. Add the `#[derive(Args)]` struct in `src/commands/<name>.rs` and implement
   `core::Command`.
4. Register the variant in `src/cli.rs::Commands` and `as_command()`.
5. Re-export the type from `src/commands/mod.rs`.
6. Add a smoke assertion in `crates/actr-cli/tests/cli_shape.rs`.
7. Document the command in this README if it changes the top-level shape.

## Runtime config vs manifest

Two TOML files, easily confused:

| File | Owned by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.toml` | developer | Project metadata, service `[package]`, proto exports, dependencies. Signed as part of `.actr`. |
| `actr.toml` | operator | Runtime config: package path, signaling URL, realm, data dir. Consumed by `actr run`. |

Commands that touch `manifest.toml` use `--manifest-path` / `-m`.
Commands that touch `actr.toml` use `--config` / `-c`.
